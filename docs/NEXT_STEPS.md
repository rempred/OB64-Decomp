# Next Steps

This is the immediate work queue for the Rev 0 decomp repo. Keep it short and
update it when a task becomes durable, blocked, or complete.

## Setup Complete

The setup phase is complete. The repo can verify Rev 0 identity, whole-ROM
coverage, real GNU MIPS binutils, first tracked chunk real assembly, raw rebuild,
full-ROM source-manifest audit, and assembled-code rebuild with one command.

Current passing commands:

```powershell
node tools/verify_setup.js
```

Current source mix: 1 tracked composite real-assembler chunk
(`0x00001000..0x00011000`) made from 177 tracked source files, plus 99 generated
fallback chunks. **Chunk 0 is fully split into named functions**
(`0x00001000..0x00011000`); next is chunk 1.

The assembled code-region SHA256 is
`40D4E7875BA50F005788611C63CF9C42D9154339B36793556BF045C25B64B409`; the full
ROM rebuild SHA256 remains
`571E83396BC81E70DA4C0A20313D82DBD7DFE685F2C37418C8E27F927E2CC67A`.

Current full-ROM source manifest:

- 1,059 entries.
- 0 unknown bytes.
- 6,510,444 `original_mips` bytes.
- 35,432,596 non-code/raw/data/archive source bytes.
- 2,469,141 ambiguous bytes preserved explicitly.
- 3 tracked non-code source-owner files / 44,029 bytes.
- 1,055 ignored generated non-code source-owner fallback files / 35,388,567
  bytes.
- Source-manifest rebuild exact.

## Active Goal

Expand toward full-ROM no-gap source representation without losing exact rebuild
coverage or overclassifying data as MIPS.

## Full-ROM Coverage Track: Code/Data Boundary (opened 2026-06-21)

`tools/audit_code_region.js` (read-only; reports under
`build/coverage/rev0-code-region-audit.json/.md`) found that the configured code
region `0x00001000..0x0063676C` is conservative: executable MIPS only occupies
`0x00001000..0x002B89B4`, and the trailing `0x002B89B4..0x0063676C`
(3,661,240 bytes, 56.24%) has zero `jr $ra` and is non-code data emitted as
`.word` `original_mips`. Evidence and method: `docs/CODE_REGION_AUDIT.md`.

Review follow-up (2026-06-21): `audit_code_region.js` now also runs a static
control-flow edge audit and found **no credible code edge into the tail** (0
PC-relative branch targets, 0 J/JAL targets resolving to a known function; the 7
raw J/JAL-into-tail hits are an embedded data ramp table at `0x001A42A4`). The
tool also hardened parent-input handling (missing/corrupt parent DB is a hard
error unless `--allow-missing-parent-db`). The control-flow prerequisite for
reclassification is satisfied; the exact boundary is still unpinned, so do NOT
reclassify yet.

Next on this track (each step must keep `node tools/verify_setup.js` green):

1. Refine the exact code/data boundary near `0x002B89B4` (first/last `jr $ra`,
   alignment padding, any structural marker just past the last detected
   function). Treat the boundary byte as unproven until pinned.
2. Reclassify `0x002B89B4..0x0063676C` from `code`/`original_mips` to a data
   source form across `config/segments/rev0.yaml`, the coverage ledger, and the
   full-ROM source manifest. The original-MIPS extraction/assembly range shrinks
   to the executable extent; the tail becomes a data owner. The rebuilt ROM
   SHA256 must stay `571E8339...CC67A`.
3. Once the boundary is final, wire `audit_code_region.js` into a coverage gate
   so "no proven code outside the executable extent" stays enforced.

Run anytime:

```powershell
node tools/audit_code_region.js
```

## Ordered Work

1. Promote the next curated tracked non-code source-owner batch.

   The first tracked batch is done under `data/source-owners/rev0/`:
   `raw_header`, `raw_structural_gap`, and ambiguous `raw_tail_data`. Next,
   choose another small batch under `data/` or `assets/`. Keep archive gaps raw
   and explicitly ambiguous unless repeatable scanner evidence improves the
   classification.

2. Keep tracked-owner verification wired into the rebuild path.

   `tools/extract_non_code_sources.js` now prefers verified tracked owners and
   generates fallback owners for the rest. Keep `node tools/verify_setup.js`
   green after every promotion.

3. Continue splitting into chunk 1.

   Chunk 0 (`0x00001000..0x00011000`) is fully split into named functions: boot/
   resource/display-list/probe/state-slot/command-stream helpers (`0x1000..0xB030`),
   the resource-archive loader + custom decompressor (`0xB030..0xF22C`, dossier
   `boot-resource-decode-subsystem-B030-F22C.md`), and codec/libc/vec3/text/IO
   (`0xF22C..0x11000`, dossier `boot-codec-libc-vec3-F22C-11000.md`).

   **Next frontier: `0x00011000` (chunk 1).** BLOCKER to clear first:
   `tools/promote_original_mips.js` overwrites `asm/original/rev0/manifest.json`
   with ONLY the newly-promoted chunk, so it would clobber chunk 0's 177-part
   composite. Fix it to MERGE (load existing manifest, append new chunk by range,
   refuse overwrite unless `--force`); then promote chunk 1
   (`code_00011000_00021000.s`) and split with `split_original_mips_part.js`.
   Note the chunk-boundary straddler `euler_to_matrix_full` `0x10FE0..0x11168`:
   its tail `[0x11000,0x11168)` is the head of chunk 1's first file. Reaching the
   4% target `0x0001CD34` is ~201 chunk-1 functions (25 preamble-orphans + 26
   dual/secondary entries per the boundary planner) — budget heavy boundary
   validation; seed with `node tools/dump_function_context.js --start 0x11000
   --end <next>` (exclusive ends now correct).

4. Keep the setup gate green.

   Re-run `node tools/verify_setup.js` after each split/promotion. Required
   result: PASS.

5. Name functions only from evidence.

   Use parent symbols, trace docs, and clear local labels. Avoid semantic naming
   unless runtime/controlled evidence supports it.

6. Promote more chunks deliberately.

   Use `tools/promote_original_mips.js` in small batches or when a subsystem
   needs that chunk. Do not commit the full generated 125 MB source set at once.

## Watch Items

- The parent archive catalog has missed whole sections in the past. Keep the
  independent LHA scan in the default coverage gate.
- The `archive/audio` overlap at `0x00925483..0x009254EF` is known and should
  remain visible until reconciled.
- Only the early boot region uses the simple `RAM = ROM + 0x8006FC00` mapping.
  Later code is overlay-loaded and needs overlay-aware address handling.
- Generated files under `build/` and `dist/` are local proof artifacts, not
  source files to commit.
